# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms for solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The TSP is a well-known optimization problem where a salesman must visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting point while minimizing the total travel cost (distance or time).

## ðŸš€ Features

- Implementation of different TSP-solving algorithms
- Performance comparison between algorithms
- A detailed PDF explaining the approaches and results

## ðŸ“„ Documentation

A comprehensive PDF is included in the repository, which explains the problem, the implemented algorithms, and their performance analysis.
